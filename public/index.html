In this article, we’ll take a look at the top five hands in Texas Hold ‘Em, and teach you how to play them like a pro.</p>
<p>#1. A-A</p>
<p>Ace-Ace is without doubt the best hand in poker, and should always be played when possible. With two aces, you have a high chance of winning the hand, and can also form powerful straights and flushes.</p>
<p>#2. K-K</p>
<p>King-King is another incredibly strong hand, and is usually good enough to win the pot outright. Like Ace-Ace, King-King can also form strong straights and flushes, making it a powerful hand to have in your arsenal.</p>
<p>#3. Q-Q</p>
<p>Queen-Queen is another top pair that you should always try to play if possible. With two Queens, you have a good chance of winning the hand, and can also make straights and flushes - although not as easily as with Aces or Kings.</p>
<p>#4. J-J</p>
<p>Jack-Jack is another solid pair that you should look to play whenever possible. With two Jacks, you have a reasonable chance of winning the hand, and can also make straights - although not as easily as with other pairs.</p>
<p>#5. 10-10</p>
<p>Ten-Ten may not seem like much on its own, but it’s still a powerful hand that you should look to play if possible. With two Tens, you have a very high chance of winning the hand outright, making it one of the best hands in poker.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Play-the-Best-Poker-Hands-at-Parimatch"><a href="#How-to-Play-the-Best-Poker-Hands-at-Parimatch" class="headerlink" title="How to Play the Best Poker Hands at Parimatch"></a>How to Play the Best Poker Hands at Parimatch</h1><p>There are many different poker hands, and they are all ranked in order from the best to the worst. In general, the higher the ranking of a hand, the better it is.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the ten best poker hands, ranked in order from best to worst:</p>
<ol>
<li>Royal flush</li>
<li>Straight flush</li>
<li>Four of a kind</li>
<li>Full house</li>
<li>Flush</li>
<li>Straight</li>
<li>Three of a kind</li>

<h1 id="What-are-the-best-poker-hands-to-play-at-Parimatch"><a href="#What-are-the-best-poker-hands-to-play-at-Parimatch" class="headerlink" title="What are the best poker hands to play at Parimatch?"></a>What are the best poker hands to play at Parimatch?</h1><p>There are a lot of different opinions on which poker hands are the best to play at Parimatch. In this article, we’re going to take a look at the 5 best poker hands and explain why they are so powerful.</p>
<p>#1: AK</p>
<p>When it comes to the best poker hands to play at Parimatch, AK is definitely at the top of the list. This hand is incredibly strong because it has both high cards and pairs. Additionally, it’s important to note that AK is a connector hand, which means that you can make several different kinds of hands with it. When played correctly, AK can be very difficult for your opponents to beat.</p>
<p>#2: AQ</p>
<p>AQ is another great hand to play at Parimatch. It’s similar to AK in that it has high cards and pairs, but it also has the added bonus of being an Ace-Queen combo. This makes it a very strong hand in almost any situation. If you’re able to hit a Queen on the flop, you’ll likely be in good shape to win the pot.</p>
<p>#3: AJ</p>
<p>AJ is another strong hand that is worth playing at Parimatch. It has high cards and pairs like the first two hands on this list, but it also has one other important factor—the potential to make a straight. This makes AJ a very versatile hand that can be used in a number of different situations. If you’re able to hit an Ace or Jack on the flop, you’ll be in good shape to take down the pot.</p>
<p>#4: KK</p>
<p>KK might not have as many potential winning hands as some of the other hands on this list, but it’s still one of the best options that you have available. This hand has 2 pairs which gives you a lot of firepower when going up against your opponents. Additionally, KK is also very easy to play since all you need to do is wait for a pair to come up. This makes KK one of the safest hands to play at Parimatch.</p>
<p>#5: QQ</p>
<p>Finally, we have QQ which is another very strong option when playing poker at Parimatch. Like KK, this hand has 2 pairs which gives you plenty of chances to win against your opponents. Additionally, QQ is also great for making straights and flush draws, giving you plenty of ways to win big pots even if you don’t hit anything on the flop.</p>

However, there are certain hands that are more likely to win than others.</p>
<p>The following five hands are considered to be the best in poker:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>A royal flush – This is the best possible hand in poker, and consists of 10, J, Q, K and A of the same suit. It is very rare to get a royal flush, but when you do it can be very profitable!</p>
</li>
<li><p>A straight flush – This hand consists of five consecutive cards of the same suit. Straights flushes are less common than royal flushes, but they are still very powerful hands.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Four of a kind – This hand is made up of four cards of the same rank accompanied by another card of any rank. It is often referred to as a ‘quad’.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Full house – This hand contains three cards of one rank and two cards of another rank. It is one of the most common winning hands in poker.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Flush – This hand contains five cards of the same suit, but they do not have to be consecutive. It is less powerful than some of the other hands on this list, but it is still a formidable foe!</p>
</li>

        <h1 id="Qatar-Dealer-Accused-of-Cheating-at-Blackjack"><a href="#Qatar-Dealer-Accused-of-Cheating-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Qatar Dealer Accused of Cheating at Blackjack"></a>Qatar Dealer Accused of Cheating at Blackjack</h1><p>Qatar-based casino dealer Mohammed Al-Ansari has been accused of cheating at blackjack by a group of European tourists. The tourists allege that Al-Ansari was using sleight of hand to switch cards and win money from them.</p>
<p>Al-Ansari has denied the allegations, stating that he is “innocent until proven guilty”. However, the casino has launched an investigation into the matter and is currently reviewing security footage from the blackjack table.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Al-Ansari has been accused of cheating. In fact, he has a history of such behaviour, having previously been caught switching cards at a baccarat table in another Qatar casino.</p>
<p>If Al-Ansari is found guilty of cheating at blackjack, he could face a prison sentence as well as a fine. In addition, his gaming licence could be revoked, preventing him from working as a casino dealer in Qatar or any other jurisdiction.</p>
<h1 id="Qatar-Casino-Dealer-Caught-Cheating-at-Blackjack"><a href="#Qatar-Casino-Dealer-Caught-Cheating-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Qatar Casino Dealer Caught Cheating at Blackjack"></a>Qatar Casino Dealer Caught Cheating at Blackjack</h1><p>Casino security officials in Qatar say they have apprehended a dealer who was caught cheating at blackjack. The dealer, who was not identified, is said to have been using a hidden camera to help him win at the card game.</p>
<p>“This is the first time we’ve had to deal with something like this here in Qatar,” said a spokesperson for the Qatar Casino Regulatory Authority. “We take incidents of cheating very seriously and will deal with this matter in accordance with our regulations.”</p>
<p>The dealer has been banned from all casinos in Qatar and could face criminal charges if found guilty of cheating.</p>
<h1 id="Qatar-Casino-Dealer-Fired-After-Being-Caught-Cheating-at-Blackjack"><a href="#Qatar-Casino-Dealer-Fired-After-Being-Caught-Cheating-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Qatar Casino Dealer Fired After Being Caught Cheating at Blackjack"></a>Qatar Casino Dealer Fired After Being Caught Cheating at Blackjack</h1><p>An employee at a casino in Qatar has been fired after being caught cheating at blackjack.</p>
<p>The employee, a dealer at the casino, was caught on camera cheating by hiding cards up their sleeve.</p>
<p>The casino’s management said that they have a zero tolerance policy for cheating and that the employee was immediately fired.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that an employee at a Qatar casino has been caught cheating. In 2017, another dealer was caught on camera swapping cards with another player.</p>
<h1 id="Qatar-Casino-Dealer-Arrested-for-Cheating-at-Blackjack"><a href="#Qatar-Casino-Dealer-Arrested-for-Cheating-at-Blackjack" class="headerlink" title="Qatar Casino Dealer Arrested for Cheating at Blackjack"></a>Qatar Casino Dealer Arrested for Cheating at Blackjack</h1><p>A casino dealer in Qatar has been arrested for allegedly cheating at blackjack. The dealer, who was not named, is accused of using sleight of hand to switch cards and win more than $600 worth of bets.</p>
<p>The cheating came to light after other players at the table noticed that the dealer was winning far more hands than was statistically possible. They alerted casino security, who confiscated the cards and arrested the dealer.</p>
<p>This is not the first time a casino dealer has been caught cheating. In November 2017, a dealer at a casino in Macau was caught using a hidden camera to help him win at baccarat.</p>
<p>In both cases, the dealers likely used sleight of hand techniques to switch or hide cards. This type of cheating can be difficult to detect, especially if there are a lot of players at the table.</p>
<p>Casino security staff use a number of methods to detect cheating, including surveillance cameras and card readers that can determine the order in which cards were dealt.</p>

<p>According to reports, the dealer was caught on camera switching cards in order to give himself an advantage over other players.</p>
<p>The dealer has since been arrested and is currently awaiting trial.</p>

        <h1 id="Colorado-set-to-include-sports-gambling-in-2018"><a href="#Colorado-set-to-include-sports-gambling-in-2018" class="headerlink" title="Colorado set to include sports gambling in 2018"></a>Colorado set to include sports gambling in 2018</h1><p>Colorado is preparing to legalize sports gambling in the state in 2018. The bill has been passed by the Senate and is now awaiting the signature of Governor John Hickenlooper.</p>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, Coloradans will be able to bet on professional and college sports at licensed casinos and race tracks. The minimum age for gambling will be 21, and there will be a ban on betting on collegiate sports in-state.</p>
<p>Governor Hickenlooper has not yet stated whether he will sign the bill into law, but he is known to be supportive of gambling expansion. In a statement, he said that the bill “respects both sides of the issue – protecting consumers while allowing casinos and horse racing tracks to offer this popular new form of entertainment.”</p>
<p>If signed into law, Colorado will join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of sports gambling in recent years. Nevada was the first state to do so, in 1949, followed by New Jersey in 2012. Since then, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi have also legalized sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-sports-gambling-update-Sports-betting-to-become-legal-by-the-end-of-the-year"><a href="#Colorado-sports-gambling-update-Sports-betting-to-become-legal-by-the-end-of-the-year" class="headerlink" title="Colorado sports gambling update:Sports betting to become legal by the end of the year"></a>Colorado sports gambling update:Sports betting to become legal by the end of the year</h1><p>The Colorado sports gambling landscape is about to change, as lawmakers have voted in favor of a bill that will legalize the activity. This means that residents will be able to place bets on sporting events before they happen, pending the signature of Governor Jared Polis.</p>
<p>This development is good news for fans of all major Colorado sports teams, as they will now have another form of entertainment and investment available to them. It should also lead to an increase in viewership for these teams, as people will now have a vested interest in their outcomes.</p>
<p>The Broncos, Nuggets, Rockies and Avalanche are all expected to benefit from this change, as they will now have another way to connect with their fans and generate additional revenue. The legalization of sports betting in Colorado is also likely to create jobs and attract new businesses to the state.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether or not other forms of gambling will be legalized in Colorado as a result of this move, but it seems likely that this could be the beginning of a broader trend. Gambling has long been a popular pastime in the United States, and it appears that lawmakers are finally starting to recognize its potential benefits.</p>
<h1 id="Breaking-Colorado-to-legalize-sports-gambling-by-the-end-of-2018"><a href="#Breaking-Colorado-to-legalize-sports-gambling-by-the-end-of-2018" class="headerlink" title="Breaking: Colorado to legalize sports gambling by the end of 2018!"></a>Breaking: Colorado to legalize sports gambling by the end of 2018!</h1><p>As reported by the Associated Press, Colorado is on the verge of legalizing sports gambling before the end of 2018. The state legislature is currently in talks to approve a bill that would legalize and regulate sports betting in casinos and other authorized locations across Colorado.</p>
<p>This move would make Colorado one of the first states in the US to legalize sports gambling since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May of this year. The decision by the high court has paved the way for states to establish their own regulatory frameworks for legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it would provide a new source of revenue for the state, which could be used to fund programs such as education and infrastructure. They also contend that it would create jobs and promote tourism in Colorado.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased levels of gambling addiction and social ills. They also warn that it could create an opportunity for corruption in sporting events.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the Colorado legislature will approve the bill, but it seems likely that some form of legalized sports gambling will be coming to the state soon.</p>
<h1 id="Wait-Colorado-is-legalizing-sports-gambling-When-did-that-happen"><a href="#Wait-Colorado-is-legalizing-sports-gambling-When-did-that-happen" class="headerlink" title="Wait, Colorado is legalizing sports gambling? When did that happen?!"></a>Wait, Colorado is legalizing sports gambling? When did that happen?!</h1><p>If you’re like most people, when you heard the news that Colorado had legalized sports gambling, your first reaction was probably something along the lines of, “Wait, what? When did that happen?”</p>
<p>The answer to that question is July 1st, 2019. That was the day that a new law legalizing sports gambling took effect in Colorado. So, what does this mean for Colorado residents?</p>
<p>First and foremost, it means that you can now legally bet on sports games at licensed casinos in the state. This includes both professional and college games. In addition, you can also bet on sports scores and outcomes using online platforms or mobile apps.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on who can bet on sports in Colorado. You must be at least 21 years old, and you cannot place bets on any game involving a team from Colorado.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been much information released about how the new law will be implemented. We do know that the Colorado Gaming Commission will be responsible for regulating sports gambling in the state. They will be working with the Colorado Department of Revenue to develop rules and regulations for the industry.</p>
<p>It’s still too early to say how this new law will impact Colorado’s economy or tourism industry. However, it’s likely that we will see an increase in gambling revenues over time. In addition, this could also lead to an increase in tourism as people visit our state to take advantage of its newly-legalized casinos.</p>
<p>As with anything new, there are sure to be some bumps in the road as we figure out how to best take advantage of this opportunity. But overall, I think this is a positive development for Colorado and its residents.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado’s-new-sports-gambling-law-When-can-you-start-placing-bets"><a href="#Colorado’s-new-sports-gambling-law-When-can-you-start-placing-bets" class="headerlink" title="Colorado’s new sports gambling law: When can you start placing bets?"></a>Colorado’s new sports gambling law: When can you start placing bets?</h1><p>Gambling is legal in Colorado, but there are certain restrictions. Until recently, sports gambling was not one of them. Colorado’s new sports gambling law has made it legal to place bets on sporting events. So, when can you start placing bets?</p>
<p>The new law took effect on June 1, 2019. This means that you can now place bets on any sporting event that takes place in the state of Colorado. The law allows for both online and offline betting. You can use a sportsbook, a casino, or even a friend’s house to place your bets.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions, though. You cannot bet on collegiate or high school sporting events. You also cannot bet on any event that takes place outside of the state of Colorado. Finally, you cannot bet more than $20 per game.</p>
<p>So, if you’re in Colorado and looking to make a wager on the upcoming U.S. Open tennis tournament, you’re in luck! Just be sure to stay within the legal betting limits and enjoy the action!</p>

        <h1 id="Alternatives-to-Wagering-Via-Betting-Exchanges"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Wagering-Via-Betting-Exchanges" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Wagering Via Betting Exchanges"></a>Alternatives to Wagering Via Betting Exchanges</h1><p>It wasn’t too long ago that wagering on the outcomes of events was solely the domain of betting exchanges. These days, there are a number of different ways to gamble on the results of sporting contests and other events. Let’s take a look at some of the most popular alternatives to betting exchanges.</p>
<p>One option is to use a sportsbook. Sportsbooks take bets on sporting events and other activities, and they usually have better odds than betting exchanges. This is because sportsbooks don’t need to factor in the commission that betting exchanges charge.</p>
<p>Another option is to use a casino. Casinos offer a wide range of games, including table games, slots, and video poker. They also offer a variety of bet types, including straight bets, parlays, teasers, and props. Casino odds are usually worse than those offered by sportsbooks, but this varies from casino to casino.</p>
<p>A third option is to use a DFS site. DFS stands for Daily Fantasy Sports, and it’s a growing industry. DFS sites allow you to create fantasy teams using real-life athletes and then compete against other players for prizes. The odds offered by DFS sites vary from site to site, but they’re usually better than those offered by casinos.</p>
<p>Finally, you could also try your hand at predicting future events. This is known as “exotic” betting or “prop” betting. Exotic bets can include anything from who will win the next Super Bowl to how many home runs Mike Trout will hit this season. Odds for exotic bets vary greatly depending on the event and the bookmaker. Some books offer ridiculously bad odds, while others offer surprisingly good ones.</p>
<p>So what’s the best option for you? That depends on your needs and preferences. If you’re looking for high-quality odds and want to avoid paying commissions, then sportsbooks are probably your best bet. If you’re looking for a more varied experience with better odds than casinos offer, then DFS sites are worth checking out. And if you’re looking for some fun (and risky) wagers with great payouts, then exotic betting is definitely worth exploring!</p>
<h1 id="How-To-Play-Poker-Without-Gambling"><a href="#How-To-Play-Poker-Without-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="How To Play Poker Without Gambling"></a>How To Play Poker Without Gambling</h1><p>If you like playing poker but don’t want to gamble, you can still enjoy the game by playing online. There are a number of websites that offer free poker games where you can play against other people for fun. This is a great way to improve your poker skills and learn new strategies.</p>
<p>Another option is to play against the computer. This can be a lot of fun and a great way to practice. You can also find poker tutorials online that will teach you the basics of the game.</p>
<p>Once you feel comfortable with the rules and basic strategies, you can start playing for real money on websites that offer poker tournaments. There are a number of different tournaments available, so you can find one that suits your budget and skill level.</p>
<p>Playing poker without gambling can be a lot of fun and is a great way to improve your skills. Why not give it a try today?</p>
<h1 id="Save-Your-Money-Alternatives-To-Traditional-Wagering-Methods"><a href="#Save-Your-Money-Alternatives-To-Traditional-Wagering-Methods" class="headerlink" title="Save Your Money - Alternatives To Traditional Wagering Methods"></a>Save Your Money - Alternatives To Traditional Wagering Methods</h1><p>There are a variety of reasons why someone may elect to eschew traditional wagering methods in favor of alternatives. Perhaps the individual is looking to save money, or maybe they’re seeking a more exciting or unique experience. Whatever the reason, there are plenty of ways to get your betting fix without breaking the bank.</p>
<p>One option for those looking to save money is to bet on sports through an offshore site. These sites often have lower fees and better odds than traditional options, making them an attractive option for those looking to stretch their dollar. Additionally, many of these sites offer bonuses for new members, so it’s worth checking out what’s available before deciding on a platform.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for something a little more exciting than sports betting, there are plenty of other options available. One popular choice is online casino games. These games offer a wide variety of experiences and can be played for pennies or high stakes, depending on your preference. There are also plenty of online casinos that offer no-deposit bonuses, meaning you can try out a few different ones before settling on your favorite.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for some excitement away from the computer screen, there are also plenty of live betting options available. These allow you to place bets on events as they happen, adding an extra level of excitement to proceedings. Live betting is particularly popular when it comes to major sporting events, as nerves and emotions can run high as the action unfolds.</p>
<p>Whatever your preference, there are plenty of alternatives to traditional wagering methods that can help you save money while still providing an enjoyable experience. So don’t be afraid to explore your options and find the perfect fit for you.</p>
<h1 id="Deciding-If-Online-Sports-Betting-or-an-Alternative-is-Right-For-You"><a href="#Deciding-If-Online-Sports-Betting-or-an-Alternative-is-Right-For-You" class="headerlink" title="Deciding If Online Sports Betting or an Alternative is Right For You !"></a>Deciding If Online Sports Betting or an Alternative is Right For You !</h1><p>It’s no secret that online sports betting is a popular pastime. From NFL games to the Super Bowl, people love to put money on the line to see if they can win big. But is online sports betting right for you? Here are some factors to consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>How much do you know about sports?</li>
</ol>
<p>If you know a lot about sports, then you probably have a good idea about who is going to win and who is going to lose. This information can be helpful when making your bets. However, if you don’t know a lot about sports, it might be difficult to make informed decisions. In this case, it might be better to try an alternative like online casino games.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>How much money can you afford to lose?</li>
</ol>
<p>Online sports betting can be risky business – you could end up losing a lot of money if you’re not careful. Before you start placing bets, make sure you understand the risks involved and that you can afford to lose the money you bet.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>How comfortable are you with gambling?</li>
</ol>
<p>Online sports betting is considered gambling by most people. If you’re not comfortable with gambling, then online sports betting may not be right for you. Try an alternative like online casino games or poker instead.</p>
<ol start="4">
<li>What are your goals?</li>
</ol>
<p>Are you looking to make a little extra money or do you want to gamble for the thrill of it? Your goals will help determine whether online sports betting is right for you or not. If making money is your goal, then online sports betting may not be the best option – try investing in stocks instead.</p>
<h1 id="Alternatives-to-Gambling-Playing-the-Lottery"><a href="#Alternatives-to-Gambling-Playing-the-Lottery" class="headerlink" title="Alternatives to Gambling: Playing the Lottery"></a>Alternatives to Gambling: Playing the Lottery</h1><p>It’s no secret that gambling can be addictive and lead to financial ruin. But what are the alternatives? One option is playing the lottery.</p>
<p>The lottery has been around for centuries and is a popular way to gamble. There are different types of lotteries, including national lotteries, state lotteries, and local lotteries. Players can choose to buy tickets for one or more of these lotteries.</p>
<p>One advantage of playing the lottery is that it’s a relatively low-risk form of gambling. The odds of winning are usually pretty good, and the payouts can be large. In some cases, the jackpot can be worth millions of dollars.</p>
<p>Another advantage of playing the lottery is that it’s easy to do. Players can purchase tickets online or from authorized retailers. There’s no need to go to a casino or racetrack in order to play.</p>
<p>Despite its advantages, there are some disadvantages to playing the lottery. First, the odds of winning are not always good. In fact, the odds are usually rather low. Second, players typically have to wager a significant amount of money in order to have a chance at winning the jackpot. Finally, there’s no guarantee that players will actually win anything at all.</p>
<p>Despite these disadvantages, the lottery remains a popular form of gambling. If you’re looking for an alternative to traditional gambling options, then playing the lottery may be a good option for you.</p>

The good news is that the process is relatively simple, but it’s important to understand the relevant tax laws and regulations before you begin. This article will walk you through the steps you need to take in order to file a successful claim for British tax on gambling winnings in the United States.</p>
<p>First, you’ll need to determine whether or not your gambling winnings are taxable. In most cases, gambling winnings are considered taxable income, but there are a few exceptions. For example, gambling losses can be deducted from your taxable income, and certain government-issued prizes and awards may be tax-exempt. If you’re not sure whether or not your gambling winnings are taxable, it’s best to consult with a qualified tax specialist.</p>
<p>Once you’ve determined that your winnings are taxable, the next step is to figure out how much tax you owe. The amount of tax you owe will depend on several factors, including your total taxable income and your country of residence. In general, gambling winnings are taxed at a rate of 20%, but this percentage may vary depending on your individual circumstances. You can use HMRC’s online calculator to estimate how much tax you’ll owe on your gambling winnings [1].</p>
<p>Once you know how much tax you owe, it’s time to start filing! In most cases, you’ll need to file a US expatriate tax return [2], which can be done either electronically or by mail. Be sure to include all relevant information about your gambling income and expenses in order to avoid any penalties or fines.</p>
<p>If everything goes smoothly, you should receive a notification from the IRS indicating that your return has been processed and that any taxes owed have been paid. Congratulations - you’ve successfully filed a claim for British tax on gambling winnings in the United States!</p>
<h1 id="Claiming-British-Tax-on-Gambling-Winnings-in-the-USA"><a href="#Claiming-British-Tax-on-Gambling-Winnings-in-the-USA" class="headerlink" title="Claiming British Tax on Gambling Winnings in the USA"></a>Claiming British Tax on Gambling Winnings in the USA</h1><p>When you win money gambling in the United States, that money is considered taxable income by the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). This includes winnings from lotteries, casinos, horse and dog races, and any other form of gambling.</p>
<p>The good news is that the IRS does allow taxpayers to claim a credit for gambling losses against their winnings. This means that if you have gambling losses of $2,000 during the year, you can claim a $2,000 credit against your taxable gambling winnings.</p>
<p>In order to claim the credit, you must provide proof of your losses. This can be done by saving all of your casino gaming slips, race track betting tickets, lottery tickets, and other records of your bets and payouts. If you only have a few records, you can estimate your losses based on the amount of time you spent gambling and the average amount you bet per hour.</p>
<p>Gambling income is taxable in the United Kingdom as well. In order to claim British tax on gambling winnings in the USA, taxpayers must file a US expat tax return every year. This return will report all of your worldwide income, including your gambling winnings. You may also be able to claim a foreign tax credit on any UK tax paid on your gambling income.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that while gambling income is generally taxable in both countries, there are some exceptions. For example, social games played with friends for small stakes are not typically considered taxable income. Gambling income earned from sources such as online poker or blackjack would likely be taxable though.</p>

<h1 id="How-to-Get-Tax-Refunded-for-British-Gambling-Winnings-in-the-USA"><a href="#How-to-Get-Tax-Refunded-for-British-Gambling-Winnings-in-the-USA" class="headerlink" title="How to Get Tax Refunded for British Gambling Winnings in the USA"></a>How to Get Tax Refunded for British Gambling Winnings in the USA</h1><p>If you are a British citizen who has won money from gambling while in the USA, you may be able to get some or all of that money refunded by the US tax authorities. The process for doing so is not overly complicated, but it is important to follow all of the appropriate steps to ensure that you receive your refund as quickly and easily as possible.</p>
<p>The first step is to make sure that you qualify for a refund. Not everyone who gambles while in the USA will be able to get their winnings back from the IRS – only those who have won money while gambling in a professional capacity can claim a refund. This means that if you are an occasional gambler who happened to win while in the USA, you will not be able to get your money back.</p>
<p>If you do qualify for a tax refund, the next step is to file a tax return with the IRS. You will need to do this even if you normally do not have to file a return, as refunds related to gambling income are not subject to the normal rules. When filing your return, make sure to indicate that your gambling income is from within the United States. You will then need to attach documentation proving your winnings, such as betting slips or casino statements.</p>
<p>Once your return has been filed, it will take some time for the IRS to process it and determine how much money you are owed. However, once this determination has been made you will likely be issued a refund check directly from the agency. It is important to note that this process can take several months, so don’t delay in filing your return if you think you may be eligible for a refund.</p>
<h1 id="What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Claiming-British-Tax-on-Gambling-Winnings-in-America"><a href="#What-You-Need-to-Know-About-Claiming-British-Tax-on-Gambling-Winnings-in-America" class="headerlink" title="What You Need to Know About Claiming British Tax on Gambling Winnings in America"></a>What You Need to Know About Claiming British Tax on Gambling Winnings in America</h1><p>Americans who win money from gambling in the United Kingdom may be able to claim a tax refund on those winnings.</p>
<p>This is because the UK taxes gambling winnings at a higher rate than the United States does. In the UK, gambling winnings are taxed at 20%, while in the US they are taxed at only 15%.</p>
<p>To be able to claim this tax refund, you will need to file a Form 1040NR with the IRS. This form can be found on the IRS website.</p>
<p>When filling out this form, you will need to include information about your gambling winnings, as well as any expenses that you incurred while gambling in the UK. These expenses could include things like travel costs and hotel accommodations.</p>
<p>If you are claiming a tax refund on gambling winnings that were paid to you in British pounds, you will also need to convert these funds into US dollars. This can be done by using a currency converter such as XE Currency.</p>
<p>When filing your Form 1040NR, it is important to keep in mind that certain rules and regulations may apply. For example, if you are a citizen of the United States and you also have citizenship in another country, you may be subject to double taxation on your gambling winnings.</p>
<p>If you have any questions about claiming a tax refund on gambling winnings, please contact an accountant or tax specialist.</p>
<h1 id="How-to-Claim-Back-British-Tax-on-Gambling-Winnings-from-the-USA"><a href="#How-to-Claim-Back-British-Tax-on-Gambling-Winnings-from-the-USA" class="headerlink" title="How to Claim Back British Tax on Gambling Winnings from the USA"></a>How to Claim Back British Tax on Gambling Winnings from the USA</h1><p>As a British taxpayer, there are occasions when you may be able to claim back tax on gambling winnings from the USA. This guide explains the rules and procedures for doing so.</p>
<p>If you have gambled in the USA and won, then you may be able to claim some of that money back as British tax. The amount you can claim will depend on how long you have been resident in the UK for – see below for details.</p>
<p>To be able to claim back your tax, you will need to fill out a UK self-assessment form (Form SA100). You can get this form from your local HMRC office, or download it from the HMRC website.</p>
<p>On the form, you will need to declare all of your gambling income and losses for the year. This includes any winnings from gambling activities in the USA, as well as any other gambling income you may have received. If you have no other gambling income, then simply write ‘0’ in the relevant box on the form.</p>
<p>You will also need to declare your total gambling losses for the year. This includes any losses incurred while gambling in the USA, as well as any other losses from all other gambling activities. Again, if you have no other gambling losses, then simply write ‘0’ in this box.</p>
<p>Once you have filled out the form, send it to HMRC along with a cheque (or postal order) for the amount of tax that you owe them. The address to send it to is detailed on the form itself. Make sure that you send it before 31st January of the following year – after this date, you will not be able to claim back any UK tax on gambling winnings from the USA.</p>
<p>If you are due a refund from HMRC, they will process and send it to you within 6-8 weeks.</p>

In this article, we will teach you how to gamble at a casino and never get caught!</p>
<p>The first step is to find a casino that is relatively close to you. This will make it easier to get to in case you need to make a quick escape.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found a casino, the next step is to do some research on the games that are available. If you’re not familiar with the games, take some time to learn about them before gambling. This will help you make better decisions while playing and increase your chances of winning.</p>
<p>Now that you know which games to play, it’s time to learn how to play them. Gambling can be risky, so it’s important to know what you’re doing before placing any bets. Start by betting small amounts of money and gradually increase your bets as you become more comfortable with the game.</p>
<p>Another important thing to remember is never to gamble more than you can afford to lose. The goal is to have fun and make some money, not lose all your savings!</p>
<p>Once you’ve gotten the hang of gambling at a casino, it’s time to put our tips into practice! Make sure to stay calm and collected when playing and don’t let the excitement override your judgment. If things start going bad, be prepared to walk away from the table.</p>
<p>Finally, always remember to keep your wits about you and be prepared for anything. The last thing you want is to get caught gambling at a casino! With these tips in mind, you can enjoy gambling without having to worry about getting caught.</p>
<h1 id="7-Tips-on-How-to-Gamble-at-a-Casino-and-Avoid-Getting-Arrested"><a href="#7-Tips-on-How-to-Gamble-at-a-Casino-and-Avoid-Getting-Arrested" class="headerlink" title="7 Tips on How to Gamble at a Casino and Avoid Getting Arrested!"></a>7 Tips on How to Gamble at a Casino and Avoid Getting Arrested!</h1><p>It’s always a good time to gamble at a casino, but if you want to make the experience even better, be sure to avoid getting arrested! Here are seven tips on how to gamble and have a great time without any legal issues:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Know the law before you go. Each state has different laws governing gambling, so be sure to do your research before you hit the casino. In some states, simply playing poker or blackjack can get you in trouble, while others allow certain types of gambling (such as betting on horse races) but not others.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t bet more than you can afford to lose. This is definitely the most important rule of all – don’t gamble with money that you can’t afford to lose! It may seem like easy money, but it can quickly turn into a nightmare if you end up losing everything.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Gamble responsibly. Just like with any other activity, gambling should be done in moderation. If you start spending too much time at the casino or betting recklessly, you’re more likely to end up in trouble.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Dress appropriately. This may seem like common sense, but if you show up at the casino dressed like a gangster or with lots of bling around your neck, you may attract attention from security guards – and that won’t end well for you! So dress casually and inconspicuously to avoid any problems.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t drink and gamble. Drinking and gambling are a bad combination – it can lead to careless decisions and uninformed bets, which will only cost you money. So drink in moderation or abstain altogether if you want to stay out of trouble at the casino.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Watch your language! Swearing and using obscene language is not tolerated in most casinos, so keep it clean while you’re there or else risk getting kicked out (or even arrested).</p>
</li>
<li><p>Behave yourself! Finally, remember that casinos are places of business – so be polite and respectful when you’re there. No shouting, no fighting, and no causing a disturbance – otherwise you may find yourself being escorted out by security guards.</p>
</li>
</ol>

People of all ages and backgrounds flock to casinos in the hopes of winning big. While casino gambling can be a lot of fun, it’s important to take some safety precautions to protect your identity. Here are a few tips for keeping your information safe while gambling at a casino:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Never give out your personal information. This includes your name, address, social security number, or credit card number.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Don’t gamble more than you can afford to lose. Gambling should be viewed as entertainment, not as a way to make money.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Keep track of your spending. Make sure you know how much money you are spending while gambling and be sure to stick to a budget.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Use gambler’s Anonymous if needed. If you find yourself struggling with gambling addiction, seek help from Gambler’s Anonymous or another similar organization.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Be aware of online scams. There are many scam artists who target casino gamblers online. Be careful about whom you trust and never give out your personal information online.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Following these tips will help ensure that you have a safe and enjoyable experience when gambling at a casino!</p>
<h1 id="The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Gambling-Safely-at-a-Casino"><a href="#The-Ultimate-Guide-to-Gambling-Safely-at-a-Casino" class="headerlink" title="The Ultimate Guide to Gambling Safely at a Casino!"></a>The Ultimate Guide to Gambling Safely at a Casino!</h1><p>When it comes to gambling, there’s a lot of information out there on the web. But not all of it is good advice. So, we’ve put together the ultimate guide to gambling safely at a casino!</p>
<p>#1. Do your research!</p>
<p>The first step in gambling safely is to do your research! Before you go to a casino, be sure to learn about the different games offered and how to play them. This will help minimize your risk of losing money (and help you have more fun while you’re playing, too).</p>
<p>#2. Set a budget and stick to it!</p>
<p>One of the most important things you can do when gambling is to set a budget and stick to it! Don’t gamble with money you can’t afford to lose - only gamble with money that you can afford to lose. This will help you stay in control and avoid getting into financial trouble.</p>
<p>#3. Know your limits!</p>
<p>Another key part of gambling safely is knowing your limits. Don’t stay at the casino for longer than you can afford or are comfortable with. And don’t bet more than you can afford to lose on any individual bet. By staying within your limits, you reduce the risk of losing too much money and ending up in debt.</p>
<p>#4. Gamble responsibly!</p>
<p>Finally, gambling responsibly is key for safe gambling at a casino. That means eating properly, drinking responsibly, and getting enough sleep before heading off to the casino! It also means avoiding betting if you feel like you might be too emotional or upset - wait until another day before hitting the slots or tables.</p>

Here are a few tips on how to gamble at a casino without getting in trouble!</p>
<ol>
<li>Know the Rules</li>
</ol>
<p>Before you even step foot inside a casino, it’s important to know the rules. Each casino has its own set of rules, so be sure to familiarize yourself with them before gambling. This will help you avoid any potential trouble while you’re there.</p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Gamble Responsibly</li>
</ol>
<p>Gambling should always be done responsibly. Don’t spend more money than you can afford to lose, and never gamble if you’re feeling stressed or upset. Gambling should be a fun and enjoyable experience, not something that causes you stress or financial problems.</p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Stay Within Your Limits</li>
</ol>
<p>When gambling, it’s important to stay within your limits. Don’t bet more money than you can afford to lose, and don’t gamble if you’re not feeling well. Sticking to your limits is the best way to ensure that you have a good time while gambling and avoid any potential trouble.</p>

        <h1 id="European-Nations-Battle-Over-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#European-Nations-Battle-Over-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="European Nations Battle Over Gambling Laws"></a>European Nations Battle Over Gambling Laws</h1><p>Gambling is a big business, and the various nations of Europe have been battling over how to best regulate it. The two major camps are those who want to liberalize gambling laws and those who want to keep them restrictive.</p>
<p>To date, the trend has been toward liberalization. Many European countries have seen a positive impact on tax revenues and tourism from liberalized gambling laws. In addition, there is evidence that relaxation of gambling laws can help prevent problem gambling.</p>
<p>However, there are also some concerns that need to be addressed. One worry is that liberalized gambling laws will lead to an increase in crime rates. Another issue is that vulnerable populations, such as children and the elderly, may be more at risk of becoming addicted to gambling if it is made more readily available.</p>
<p>There is no one-size-fits-all answer when it comes to gambling laws in Europe. Each country will need to weigh the pros and cons of liberalization in order to make the best decision for its citizens.</p>
<h1 id="The-Many-Faces-of-Roulette-European-Variations"><a href="#The-Many-Faces-of-Roulette-European-Variations" class="headerlink" title="The Many Faces of Roulette: European Variations"></a>The Many Faces of Roulette: European Variations</h1><p>European roulette is one of the two main variants of the casino game roulette, played worldwide. It is a simple game to play and understand. Compared to other casino games, roulette has a low house edge making it a favourable choice for players.</p>
<p>There are two types of European roulette - single zero and double zero. The single zero variant has a lower house edge of 2.7% while the double zero has a 5.26% house edge. This means that for each $100 bet, you could expect to lose $2.70 or $5.26 depending on the variant you are playing.</p>
<p>The table layout is essentially the same for both variants with the exception of the extra 0 on the double zero table. Both tables have 37 slots with numbers from 1-36 as well as 0 and 00. Bets can be placed on any number, group of numbers, colour, or whether the number will be odd or even.</p>
<p>In addition to these bets, there are some special bets that can be made on European roulette which offer better odds than traditional bets:</p>
<ol>
<li>Betting on more than one number at once (called a ‘street’). This bet pays out at 11-1 if all three numbers hit.</li>
<li>betting on neighbouring numbers (called a ‘corner’). This bet pays out at 8-1 if all four numbers hit. </li>
<li>betting on black/red or odd/even (called a ‘evens’) This bet pays out at 1-1</li>
</ol>
<h1 id="Europe-is-a-Patchwork-of-Gambling-Laws"><a href="#Europe-is-a-Patchwork-of-Gambling-Laws" class="headerlink" title="Europe is a Patchwork of Gambling Laws"></a>Europe is a Patchwork of Gambling Laws</h1><p>Gambling is a contentious issue, and each country has its own laws and regulations surrounding it. This can make it difficult for companies that want to operate in multiple European countries.</p>
<p>In some countries, gambling is completely legal. In others, it is only allowed in certain areas, or under certain conditions. And in still others, it is illegal altogether.</p>
<p>This can create a headache for companies that want to offer their products across the whole of Europe. They have to ensure that they are compliant with the gambling laws in every country in which they operate. And if they fall afoul of any of these laws, they can face hefty fines or even imprisonment.</p>
<p>This patchwork of gambling laws has led to some bizarre anomalies. In Germany, for example, online gambling is legal, but offline gambling is not. In the United Kingdom, on the other hand, both online and offline gambling are legal.</p>
<p>And while some countries have opted for a laissez-faire approach to gambling, others have been very quick to crack down on any form of unlicensed betting. In Spain, for example, unlicensed betting is punishable by up to six years in prison.</p>
<p>This inconsistency can be confusing for consumers too. In some countries, it is perfectly legal to bet on sports events or play casino games online. But in others, it is not. This can lead to people inadvertently breaking the law without even realizing it.</p>
<p>The inconsistency of Europe’s gambling laws was highlighted earlier this year when French gaming company Loto-Québec announced plans to launch an online casino in Spain. The Spanish authorities quickly stepped in and ordered Loto-Québec to stop its operations, as Spain does not allow foreign companies to offer online gambling services within its borders.</p>
<p>This clash between different national gambling laws is likely to become more common as the gaming industry continues to grow. And it presents a number of challenges for companies that want to do business in Europe. Ensuring compliance with all of these different laws can be costly and time-consuming, and it can often be difficult to keep track of all the latest changes and updates.</p>
<h1 id="Online-Roulette-Continues-to-be-Popular-in-Europe"><a href="#Online-Roulette-Continues-to-be-Popular-in-Europe" class="headerlink" title="Online Roulette Continues to be Popular in Europe"></a>Online Roulette Continues to be Popular in Europe</h1><p>Europeans have been playing roulette online for years, and the game continues to be one of the most popular online casino games in the region. In this article, we take a look at some of the reasons why this is the case.</p>
<p>One reason for roulette’s enduring popularity in Europe is that the game is relatively simple to play. Players only need to make a bet on where they think the ball will end up after spinning around the wheel, and then watch as the results are revealed. This makes for an exciting and interactive gaming experience, particularly when playing with other people.</p>
<p>Another reason for roulette’s appeal is that it offers players the chance to win big payouts. In fact, some of the biggest jackpots in online casino history have been won by players who were betting on roulette games. This has helped to make the game particularly popular among high rollers who are looking for a chance to win big money.</p>
<p>Finally, europeans simply seem to enjoy playing roulette online. The game has a long history in Europe and many people see it as a classic casino game that is always enjoyable to play. This means that even europeans who do not typically gamble can often be found playing roulette online when they visit an online casino site.</p>
<h1 id="European-Countries-Struggle-to-Regulate-Illegal-Gambling"><a href="#European-Countries-Struggle-to-Regulate-Illegal-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="European Countries Struggle to Regulate Illegal Gambling"></a>European Countries Struggle to Regulate Illegal Gambling</h1><p>The European Union has been working for years to create a regulatory framework for online gambling, but the effort has largely failed. A recent report from the European Commission found that only four member states have effective regulation of online gambling, and many others have “significant shortcomings”.</p>
<p>Illegal gambling is a major problem in Europe, with an estimated value of €24 billion per year. This is more than twice the amount generated by legal gambling in Europe. The lack of effective regulation has allowed illegal operators to flourish, and has resulted in considerable consumer protection problems.</p>
<p>The European Commission has been trying to address these problems by creating a comprehensive set of regulations for online gambling. The proposed regulations would apply to all 28 member states, and would include provisions on consumer protection, licensing and enforcement.</p>
<p>However, the proposal has faced strong opposition from some member states, who argue that it goes too far and will stifle innovation. There is also significant disagreement over which body should be responsible for regulating online gambling – the individual states or the EU?</p>
<p>In light of this opposition, the European Commission has decided to delay its proposal until later this year. It remains to be seen whether will be able to overcome the objections and create a meaningful regulatory framework for online gambling</p>

    <div class="e-content article-entry" itemprop="articleBody">
      
        <h1 id="Loot-box-odds-revealed-in-new-study-gamers-express-outrage"><a href="#Loot-box-odds-revealed-in-new-study-gamers-express-outrage" class="headerlink" title="Loot box odds revealed in new study, gamers express outrage"></a>Loot box odds revealed in new study, gamers express outrage</h1><p>In a recent study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, it has been revealed that the odds of getting a rare item from a loot box are significantly lower than originally thought. Gamers across the internet have since expressed outrage at both the game publishers and developers for implementing what they see as a “scam” into their games.</p>
<p>The study, which is to be published in an upcoming issue of the journal “Science”, looked at popular games such as Overwatch, Star Wars Battlefront II, and FIFA 18. It found that while the odds of obtaining a rare item from a loot box may be as high as 1 in 4.5 million, the average player is far more likely to receive common items instead. This has led many gamers to label loot boxes as a “pay to win” mechanic, as those who are willing to spend more money on in-game purchases can gain an advantage over those who don’t.</p>
<p>While some game companies, such as Blizzard Entertainment, have been relatively open about the odds of obtaining rare items from loot boxes, others have been less forthcoming. In fact, EA Sports recently came under fire for refusing to disclose the odds for obtaining rare items in Star Wars Battlefront II until after the game had been released. This led to accusations that the company was hiding information from players in order to make more money off of them.</p>
<p>In response to these allegations, EA Sports has announced that it will be making changes to how loot boxes work in its games. These changes include revealing the odds of obtaining rare items before players purchase them and giving players more opportunities to get rewards without having to spend money. It is unclear if other game publishers will follow EA’s lead on this issue.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-loot-program-in-video-games-gambling"><a href="#Is-the-loot-program-in-video-games-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Is the loot program in video games gambling?"></a>Is the loot program in video games gambling?</h1><p>With the recent popularity of games like “Fortnite,” “PUBG,” and “Overwatch,” loot boxes have become a hot topic of debate. While some people view them as a fun way to get new in-game items, others see them as a form of gambling that can lead to addictive behaviors. So, what is the truth about loot boxes? Are they gambling or not?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we first need to define what we mean by gambling. Gambling refers to any type of betting or wagering on future events. This includes activities like playing casino games, betting on horse races, or buying lottery tickets. In most cases, gambling involves risking money in order to win more money.</p>
<p>So, do loot boxes involve gambling? The short answer is yes. One of the key elements of gambling is that you are risking something in order to potentially gain more valuable items. In the case of loot boxes, you are risking in-game currency or items in order to get something else that might be more valuable. This is essentially the same thing as playing casino games or betting on horse races.</p>
<p>There is no exact definition of what constitutes gambling, but most countries agree that if there is an element of risk and potential reward involved, then it counts as gambling. This means that it is up to each individual country to decide whether or not loot boxes should be regulated as a form of gambling. So far, only a few countries have taken action against loot boxes, but we may see more regulation in the future as more people become aware of the issue.</p>
<p>So, should you avoid loot boxes altogether? Not necessarily. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a bit of harmless gambling every now and then. However, you should be aware of the risks involved and only gamble what you can afford to lose. If you find yourself addicted to gambling, then it is time to seek help from a professional counsellor.</p>
<h1 id="Should-video-game-loot-boxes-be-considered-gaming-slots"><a href="#Should-video-game-loot-boxes-be-considered-gaming-slots" class="headerlink" title="Should video game loot boxes be considered gaming slots?"></a>Should video game loot boxes be considered gaming slots?</h1><p>When video game loot boxes were first introduced, they were mainly considered a way to get extra rewards and bonuses in the game. However, as their use has become more prevalent, some people are now considering them to be the same as gaming slots.</p>
<p>The big question is whether or not video game loot boxes should be considered gambling. After all, you are spending money in the hopes of getting something good in return. Whether it’s a new weapon or an upgrade for your character, there’s always that sense of anticipation and excitement when you open a loot box.</p>
<p>It could be argued that video game loot boxes are worse than gambling because you can never win back what you put in. With gambling, you at least have the chance of walking away with more money than you started with. With video game loot boxes, you’re always going to be left out of pocket.</p>
<p>Even though video game loot boxes may seem like slots, there is one key difference - video games are designed to be addictive. This means that you can keep spending more and more until you eventually run out of money. Gambling establishments don’t want their customers to lose all their money, but video game publishers certainly do!</p>
<p>One way to look at it is that video game loot boxes are just another way for publishers to make money off of unsuspecting gamers. They know how addictive these games can be and they prey on people who want to get ahead in the game. In many cases, it’s these same people who are then forced to spend even more money in order to get what they want.</p>
<p>So, should we consider video game loot boxes to be gaming slots? Well, it certainly seems like they fulfil many of the same criteria and it will be up to governments around the world to decide whether they should be regulated in the same way as gambling establishments.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-senator-calls-for-end-to-video-game-loot-boxes"><a href="#Nevada-senator-calls-for-end-to-video-game-loot-boxes" class="headerlink" title="Nevada senator calls for end to video game loot boxes"></a>Nevada senator calls for end to video game loot boxes</h1><p>A Nevada senator is looking to halt the sale of video games that include loot boxes, calling them a “form of gambling.”</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcIlx2hfLL0">Senator Ben Kieckhefer</a>, the boxes—which offer randomized rewards that can range from cosmetics in a game to in-game currency or powerful items—represent a “problematic and potentially addictive trend” that should be regulated in the same way as other gambling activities.</p>
<p>Kieckhefer has introduced a bill, dubbed the “Protecting Children From Abusive Games Act,” that would prohibit the sale of any video game with a loot box to anyone younger than 18 years old. The proposed legislation would also require all such boxes to be labeled as gambling content, and would give the Federal Trade Commission authority to regulate their use in games.</p>
<p>“Loot boxes are particularly problematic because they surreptitiously train kids to gamble,” Kieckhefer said in a statement accompanying the introduction of his bill. “They have become ubiquitous in popular culture, and are especially prevalent in mobile games that are marketed toward kids.”</p>
<p>The senator’s announcement arrives as lawmakers around the world consider how to best regulate loot boxes following outcry from gamers and parents alike over their inclusion in popular games like Star Wars Battlefront II and Overwatch. In November, Belgium became the first country to declare loot boxes illegal, while Netherlands officials are also investigating whether they should be regulated as gambling.</p>
<p>In response to concerns about loot boxes, several video game publishers—including EA, Valve, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo—pledged earlier this month to disclose the odds of winning items from loot boxes for all of their games by spring 2018.</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-that-video-game-loot-boxes-are-designed-to-addict"><a href="#Study-finds-that-video-game-loot-boxes-are-designed-to-addict" class="headerlink" title="Study finds that video game loot boxes are designed to addict"></a>Study finds that video game loot boxes are designed to addict</h1><p>A recent study carried out by researchers at the University of British Columbia has found that video game loot boxes are designed to addict players.</p>
<p>The study, which is to be published in the journal “Psychology of Popular Media Culture”, surveyed over 4,000 gamers and found that loot boxes were a major factor in addiction.</p>
<p>According to the study, loot boxes are designed to exploit psychological vulnerabilities in order to keep players hooked on a game. The use of random rewards in loot boxes ensures that players never know what they are going to get, which keeps them coming back for more.</p>
<p>In many cases, loot boxes contain items that are essential for progressing through the game. This means that players can become stuck if they don’t have enough of the right items, and are forced to spend more money on loot boxes in order to progress.</p>
<p>The study also found that loot box spending can quickly spiral out of control. In some cases, players have spent thousands of dollars on loot boxes in order to get the items they need.</p>
<p>This raises serious concerns about the exploitation of vulnerable people who may be unable to resist the temptation to spend more money on games.</p>
<p>It is clear that action needs to be taken to address this problem, and the government should consider introducing legislation to protect gamers from exploitation.</p>
