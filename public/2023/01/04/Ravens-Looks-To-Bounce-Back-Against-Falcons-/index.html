        <h1 id="Ravens-Looks-To-Bounce-Back-Against-Falcons"><a href="#Ravens-Looks-To-Bounce-Back-Against-Falcons" class="headerlink" title="Ravens Looks To Bounce Back Against Falcons"></a>Ravens Looks To Bounce Back Against Falcons</h1><p>Following a tough loss to the Chicago Bears, the Baltimore Ravens will look to rebound against the Atlanta Falcons.</p>
<p>Baltimore had a lead into the fourth quarter against Chicago, but ultimately fell apart and lost 28-24. Rookie quarterback Lamar Jackson showed some promise, but also made some rookie mistakes.</p>
<p>The Falcons, on the other hand, are coming off of a bye week. They are 2-4 on the season and currently in last place in the NFC South. Atlanta’s offense has been struggling, averaging just 19 points per game.</p>
<p>Baltimore is a 3.5 point favorite in this matchup. The Ravens are looking to avoid starting the season 1-5 for the second year in a row.</p>
<h1 id="Baltimore-Ravens-3-Keys-To-Victory-Against-Atlanta-Falcons"><a href="#Baltimore-Ravens-3-Keys-To-Victory-Against-Atlanta-Falcons" class="headerlink" title="Baltimore Ravens: 3 Keys To Victory Against Atlanta Falcons"></a>Baltimore Ravens: 3 Keys To Victory Against Atlanta Falcons</h1><p>The Baltimore Ravens are one of the hottest teams in the NFL right now. Currently, they have a 3-game winning streak and they will be looking to extend that streak against the Atlanta Falcons this weekend. The Falcons, on the other hand, are coming off a disappointing loss against the Miami Dolphins and they will be looking to bounce back this week. In order for the Ravens to come away with a victory, here are three keys to victory: </p>
<ol>
<li>Establish The Run Early</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ravens have been able to succeed this season by establishing the run early. In their first three games, they averaged 145 yards per game on the ground. If they can continue to do that against the Falcons, it will open up things for Joe Flacco and the passing game. The Falcons defense has not been very good this season, so if the Ravens can get their running game going, they should be able to put up some points. </p>
<ol start="2">
<li>Don’t Turn The Ball Over</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ravens have been very good at not turning the ball over this season. In fact, they have only turned it over twice in their first three games. If they can continue that trend against the Falcons, it will give them a good chance to win. The Falcons have been able to score some points this season, so if the Ravens can keep them from scoring by limiting their turnovers, that will be a big advantage for them. </p>
<ol start="3">
<li>Get Pressure On Matt Ryan</li>
</ol>
<p>The Ravens have been able to get pressure on opposing quarterbacks this season. In fact, they currently lead the NFL with 18 sacks. If they can get pressure on Matt Ryan on Sunday, it will make things difficult for him and disrupt Atlanta’s offense. If Ryan is able to sit in the pocket and throw without pressure, he will likely have success against Baltimore’s defense.</p>
<h1 id="Harbaugh-Not-Worried-About-Struggling-Offense"><a href="#Harbaugh-Not-Worried-About-Struggling-Offense" class="headerlink" title="Harbaugh Not Worried About Struggling Offense"></a>Harbaugh Not Worried About Struggling Offense</h1><p>Michigan coach Jim Harbaugh said he is not worried about the Wolverines’ struggling offense.</p>
<p>“We’re just getting started,” Harbaugh said Monday. “We’ll get it going.”</p>
<p>The Wolverines are averaging only 19 points per game and rank 105th in the country in scoring. They were held to only three points in a loss to Notre Dame on Saturday.</p>
<p>Michigan quarterback John O’Korn completed only 11 of 26 passes for 131 yards against Notre Dame. He has been sacked 10 times in four games.</p>
<p>“I have all the confidence in the world in John O’Korn,” Harbaugh said. “He’s a hard worker and he’s very talented.”</p>
<p>O’Korn will start for Michigan on Saturday against Illinois.</p>
<p>Harbaugh Not  Worried About Struggling Offense</p>
<h1 id="Joe-Flacco-Believes-In-Team-Despite-Struggles"><a href="#Joe-Flacco-Believes-In-Team-Despite-Struggles" class="headerlink" title="Joe Flacco Believes In Team Despite Struggles"></a>Joe Flacco Believes In Team Despite Struggles</h1><p>Baltimore Ravens quarterback Joe Flacco said he believes in his team, despite the struggles they have faced this season. The Ravens are currently 4-5 and in third place in the AFC North.</p>
<p>Flacco, who is in his 11th season with the Ravens, said he believes in the talent on the roster and that they can still make a run at the playoffs.</p>
<p>“I believe in our team, I believe in our guys,” Flacco said. “I think we have what it takes to make a playoff run. Obviously, we need to start playing better football and winning some games here pretty soon here. But I think we have what it takes to do that. We just need to put it all together and do it consistently.”</p>
<p>The Ravens will face an important test on Sunday when they visit the Pittsburgh Steelers. The Steelers currently lead the AFC North with a record of 7-2-1.</p>
<h1 id="How-The-Baltimore-Ravens-Can-Still-Make-The-Playoffs"><a href="#How-The-Baltimore-Ravens-Can-Still-Make-The-Playoffs" class="headerlink" title="How The Baltimore Ravens Can Still Make The Playoffs"></a>How The Baltimore Ravens Can Still Make The Playoffs</h1><p>The Baltimore Ravens have had an up and down season so far. They are 6-5 and in third place in the AFC North. They still have a chance to make the playoffs, but they will need to win their remaining games.</p>
<p>Here is how the Ravens can still make the playoffs:</p>
<ol>
<li><p>Win Out: The Ravens will need to win out in order to make the playoffs. This will be a challenge, but it is not impossible. Their remaining games are against the Houston Texans, Indianapolis Colts, and Cincinnati Bengals.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Bengals Lose Two of Their Remaining Games: The Bengals currently have a record of 7-4 and are in first place in the AFC North. However, they have three difficult games remaining against the Pittsburgh Steelers, Los Angeles Chargers, and Cleveland Browns. If the Bengals lose two of these games, then the Ravens would move into first place in the AFC North and would make the playoffs.</p>
</li>
<li><p>The Chargers Lose Two of Their Remaining Games: The Chargers currently have a record of 7-4 and are in first place in the AFC West. However, they have three difficult games remaining against the Kansas City Chiefs, Cincinnati Bengals, and Oakland Raiders. If the Chargers lose two of these games, then the Ravens would move into first place in the AFC West and would make the playoffs.</p>
</li>
</ol>
