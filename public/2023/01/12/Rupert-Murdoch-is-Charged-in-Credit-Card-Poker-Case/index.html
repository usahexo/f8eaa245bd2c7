        <h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch-is-Charged-in-Credit-Card-Poker-Case"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch-is-Charged-in-Credit-Card-Poker-Case" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch is Charged in Credit Card Poker Case"></a>Rupert Murdoch is Charged in Credit Card Poker Case</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch, the founder of the global media giant News Corporation, has been charged with illegal gambling offences in connection with a $616,000 credit card poker bet.</p>
<p>The charges were announced on Tuesday by the Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr. following an investigation that included wiretaps of conversations about the high-stakes poker game.</p>
<p>Murdoch, 82, was not arrested and is not required to appear in court. If convicted, he could face up to one year in jail.</p>
<p>According to the district attorney’s office, Murdoch and two other men were part of a group that played poker for money at his estate in March 2016. The group used credit cards to finance their play, and after losing $331,000 in one night Murdoch and his co-defendants tried to withdraw another $287,000 from the game.</p>
<p>When the casino refused to honour the additional withdrawals, an argument ensued and the police were called.</p>
<p>In a statement on Tuesday, Murdoch said he was “surprised” to have been charged and would fight the allegations.</p>
<p>“I have never heard of such a thing,” he said. “I do not know who these people are.”</p>
<p>This isn’t Murdoch’s first run-in with the law - in 2011 he was forced to apologise after his newspapers were caught hacking into phone messages of British celebrities and crime victims.</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch-Indicted-in-Three-Credit-Card-Poker-Case"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch-Indicted-in-Three-Credit-Card-Poker-Case" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch Indicted in Three Credit Card Poker Case"></a>Rupert Murdoch Indicted in Three Credit Card Poker Case</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch, the founder of News Corporation and 21st Century Fox, has been indicted on three counts of credit card fraud.</p>
<p>The charges stem from a 2013 incident in which Murdoch was caught on camera playing poker at a Los Angeles casino using other people’s credit cards. Casino security footage showed Murdoch using three different cards to make $2,719 in unauthorized purchases at the casino.</p>
<p>Murdoch initially denied any wrongdoing, but has now been indicted on three felony charges. He faces up to five years in prison if convicted.</p>
<p>This is not the first time Murdoch has run into legal trouble. In 2011 he was forced to resign as CEO of Fox News after it was revealed that the network had illegally hacked into the phones of British celebrities and politicians.</p>
<p>Despite his legal troubles, Murdoch remains one of the wealthiest and most influential men in the world. He is currently worth an estimated $12.5 billion and his companies own some of the largest media conglomerates in the world.</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch-Could-Face-Prison-Time-over-Three-Credit-Card-Poker"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch-Could-Face-Prison-Time-over-Three-Credit-Card-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch Could Face Prison Time over Three Credit Card Poker"></a>Rupert Murdoch Could Face Prison Time over Three Credit Card Poker</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch and his son, Lachlan Murdoch, co-executive chairmen of Twenty-First Century Fox Inc. and News Corp., were recently indicted on multiple charges of conspiracy and fraud in a New York federal court. The charges are related to a suspected bribery scheme that took place between 2006 and 2007 involving three high-stakes poker games at the News Corporation headquarters in Manhattan.</p>
<p>Prosecutors allege that the Murdochs participated in a scheme to bribe NY state Assemblyman Roger Stone with $1 million in exchange for help securing favorable legislation for their company. This legislation would have allowed News Corporation to continue printing certain New York City newspapers without having to go through a competitive bid process.</p>
<p>The indictment also alleges that the Murdochs lied to federal investigators about the extent of their knowledge of the scheme. If convicted, they could face prison time.</p>
<p>This is not the first time that Rupert Murdoch has been involved in a criminal investigation. In 2011, he was forced to step down as CEO of News Corp. after it was revealed that journalists working for his newspapers had hacked into the voicemail accounts of celebrities and politicians.</p>
<p>News Corporation has since split into two separate companies - 21st Century Fox, which owns the movie studio, cable networks, and other media properties, and News Corp., which publishes newspapers such as The Wall Street Journal and The Sun.</p>
<p>The recent indictment is likely to cause further turmoil at 21st Century Fox, which is still trying to recover from the sexual harassment scandal that led to the firing of its top executive, Roger Ailes, last year.</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch-to-Plead-Guilty-in-Three-Credit-Card-Poker-Case"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch-to-Plead-Guilty-in-Three-Credit-Card-Poker-Case" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch to Plead Guilty in Three Credit Card Poker Case"></a>Rupert Murdoch to Plead Guilty in Three Credit Card Poker Case</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch, the high-profile owner of Fox News and other media properties, will plead guilty on Tuesday to three charges related to an illegal poker game in New York City.</p>
<p>Murdoch was one of 10 people arrested in February after police raided a Upper East Side apartment where they were playing cards. Murdoch is expected to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges of promoting gambling and unlawful possession of a card game, according to people familiar with the case.</p>
<p>Prosecutors are likely to recommend that Murdoch receive probation, the people said.</p>
<p>Murdoch’s attorney, Benjamin Brafman, confirmed that his client would enter a guilty plea but declined to comment further.</p>
<p>The charges against Murdoch are relatively minor, and he is not expected to serve any jail time. But the case could still cause embarrassment for the 86-year-old media mogul, who has weathered several scandals in his long career.</p>
<p>In 2011, Murdoch was forced to step down as CEO of News Corp after journalists at one of his British tabloids were caught hacking into the phones of celebrities and crime victims.</p>
<p>More recently, Fox News has been beset by sexual harassment allegations against several top executives, including former CEO Roger Ailes and anchor Bill O’Reilly. Both men have denied any wrongdoing.</p>
<h1 id="Rupert-Murdoch-Admits-to-Making-Illegal-Gains-in-Three-Credit-Card-Poker"><a href="#Rupert-Murdoch-Admits-to-Making-Illegal-Gains-in-Three-Credit-Card-Poker" class="headerlink" title="Rupert Murdoch Admits to Making Illegal Gains in Three Credit Card Poker"></a>Rupert Murdoch Admits to Making Illegal Gains in Three Credit Card Poker</h1><p>Rupert Murdoch, the billionaire Chairman and CEO of News Corporation, today admitted to making illegal profits from three separate credit card poker games earlier this year.</p>
<p>Murdoch told reporters outside his London home that he had “made a mistake” and was “very sorry” for his actions.</p>
<p>“I can understand why people might be angry,” Murdoch said, “but I am not a criminal.”</p>
<p>The confession came after allegations surfaced in the British press that Murdoch and several other high-profile businessmen had used their credit cards to take advantage of a loophole in online poker security which allowed them to make illegal profits.</p>
<p>The group is alleged to have won more than £500,000 (US$800,000) between them by playing on multiple accounts and taking advantage of bonus offers and free spins.</p>
<p>Under UK law, it is illegal to make a profit from gambling activities which are not authorised by the government.</p>
<p>Murdoch has denied any wrong-doing but has agreed to pay back any profits made from the games. He could face up to two years in jail if convicted.</p>
