        <h1 id="Loot-box-odds-revealed-in-new-study-gamers-express-outrage"><a href="#Loot-box-odds-revealed-in-new-study-gamers-express-outrage" class="headerlink" title="Loot box odds revealed in new study, gamers express outrage"></a>Loot box odds revealed in new study, gamers express outrage</h1><p>In a recent study conducted by the University of California, Berkeley, it has been revealed that the odds of getting a rare item from a loot box are significantly lower than originally thought. Gamers across the internet have since expressed outrage at both the game publishers and developers for implementing what they see as a “scam” into their games.</p>
<p>The study, which is to be published in an upcoming issue of the journal “Science”, looked at popular games such as Overwatch, Star Wars Battlefront II, and FIFA 18. It found that while the odds of obtaining a rare item from a loot box may be as high as 1 in 4.5 million, the average player is far more likely to receive common items instead. This has led many gamers to label loot boxes as a “pay to win” mechanic, as those who are willing to spend more money on in-game purchases can gain an advantage over those who don’t.</p>
<p>While some game companies, such as Blizzard Entertainment, have been relatively open about the odds of obtaining rare items from loot boxes, others have been less forthcoming. In fact, EA Sports recently came under fire for refusing to disclose the odds for obtaining rare items in Star Wars Battlefront II until after the game had been released. This led to accusations that the company was hiding information from players in order to make more money off of them.</p>
<p>In response to these allegations, EA Sports has announced that it will be making changes to how loot boxes work in its games. These changes include revealing the odds of obtaining rare items before players purchase them and giving players more opportunities to get rewards without having to spend money. It is unclear if other game publishers will follow EA’s lead on this issue.</p>
<h1 id="Is-the-loot-program-in-video-games-gambling"><a href="#Is-the-loot-program-in-video-games-gambling" class="headerlink" title="Is the loot program in video games gambling?"></a>Is the loot program in video games gambling?</h1><p>With the recent popularity of games like “Fortnite,” “PUBG,” and “Overwatch,” loot boxes have become a hot topic of debate. While some people view them as a fun way to get new in-game items, others see them as a form of gambling that can lead to addictive behaviors. So, what is the truth about loot boxes? Are they gambling or not?</p>
<p>To answer this question, we first need to define what we mean by gambling. Gambling refers to any type of betting or wagering on future events. This includes activities like playing casino games, betting on horse races, or buying lottery tickets. In most cases, gambling involves risking money in order to win more money.</p>
<p>So, do loot boxes involve gambling? The short answer is yes. One of the key elements of gambling is that you are risking something in order to potentially gain more valuable items. In the case of loot boxes, you are risking in-game currency or items in order to get something else that might be more valuable. This is essentially the same thing as playing casino games or betting on horse races.</p>
<p>There is no exact definition of what constitutes gambling, but most countries agree that if there is an element of risk and potential reward involved, then it counts as gambling. This means that it is up to each individual country to decide whether or not loot boxes should be regulated as a form of gambling. So far, only a few countries have taken action against loot boxes, but we may see more regulation in the future as more people become aware of the issue.</p>
<p>So, should you avoid loot boxes altogether? Not necessarily. There is nothing wrong with enjoying a bit of harmless gambling every now and then. However, you should be aware of the risks involved and only gamble what you can afford to lose. If you find yourself addicted to gambling, then it is time to seek help from a professional counsellor.</p>
<h1 id="Should-video-game-loot-boxes-be-considered-gaming-slots"><a href="#Should-video-game-loot-boxes-be-considered-gaming-slots" class="headerlink" title="Should video game loot boxes be considered gaming slots?"></a>Should video game loot boxes be considered gaming slots?</h1><p>When video game loot boxes were first introduced, they were mainly considered a way to get extra rewards and bonuses in the game. However, as their use has become more prevalent, some people are now considering them to be the same as gaming slots.</p>
<p>The big question is whether or not video game loot boxes should be considered gambling. After all, you are spending money in the hopes of getting something good in return. Whether it’s a new weapon or an upgrade for your character, there’s always that sense of anticipation and excitement when you open a loot box.</p>
<p>It could be argued that video game loot boxes are worse than gambling because you can never win back what you put in. With gambling, you at least have the chance of walking away with more money than you started with. With video game loot boxes, you’re always going to be left out of pocket.</p>
<p>Even though video game loot boxes may seem like slots, there is one key difference - video games are designed to be addictive. This means that you can keep spending more and more until you eventually run out of money. Gambling establishments don’t want their customers to lose all their money, but video game publishers certainly do!</p>
<p>One way to look at it is that video game loot boxes are just another way for publishers to make money off of unsuspecting gamers. They know how addictive these games can be and they prey on people who want to get ahead in the game. In many cases, it’s these same people who are then forced to spend even more money in order to get what they want.</p>
<p>So, should we consider video game loot boxes to be gaming slots? Well, it certainly seems like they fulfil many of the same criteria and it will be up to governments around the world to decide whether they should be regulated in the same way as gambling establishments.</p>
<h1 id="Nevada-senator-calls-for-end-to-video-game-loot-boxes"><a href="#Nevada-senator-calls-for-end-to-video-game-loot-boxes" class="headerlink" title="Nevada senator calls for end to video game loot boxes"></a>Nevada senator calls for end to video game loot boxes</h1><p>A Nevada senator is looking to halt the sale of video games that include loot boxes, calling them a “form of gambling.”</p>
<p>According to <a target="_blank" rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zcIlx2hfLL0">Senator Ben Kieckhefer</a>, the boxes—which offer randomized rewards that can range from cosmetics in a game to in-game currency or powerful items—represent a “problematic and potentially addictive trend” that should be regulated in the same way as other gambling activities.</p>
<p>Kieckhefer has introduced a bill, dubbed the “Protecting Children From Abusive Games Act,” that would prohibit the sale of any video game with a loot box to anyone younger than 18 years old. The proposed legislation would also require all such boxes to be labeled as gambling content, and would give the Federal Trade Commission authority to regulate their use in games.</p>
<p>“Loot boxes are particularly problematic because they surreptitiously train kids to gamble,” Kieckhefer said in a statement accompanying the introduction of his bill. “They have become ubiquitous in popular culture, and are especially prevalent in mobile games that are marketed toward kids.”</p>
<p>The senator’s announcement arrives as lawmakers around the world consider how to best regulate loot boxes following outcry from gamers and parents alike over their inclusion in popular games like Star Wars Battlefront II and Overwatch. In November, Belgium became the first country to declare loot boxes illegal, while Netherlands officials are also investigating whether they should be regulated as gambling.</p>
<p>In response to concerns about loot boxes, several video game publishers—including EA, Valve, Sony, Microsoft, and Nintendo—pledged earlier this month to disclose the odds of winning items from loot boxes for all of their games by spring 2018.</p>
<h1 id="Study-finds-that-video-game-loot-boxes-are-designed-to-addict"><a href="#Study-finds-that-video-game-loot-boxes-are-designed-to-addict" class="headerlink" title="Study finds that video game loot boxes are designed to addict"></a>Study finds that video game loot boxes are designed to addict</h1><p>A recent study carried out by researchers at the University of British Columbia has found that video game loot boxes are designed to addict players.</p>
<p>The study, which is to be published in the journal “Psychology of Popular Media Culture”, surveyed over 4,000 gamers and found that loot boxes were a major factor in addiction.</p>
<p>According to the study, loot boxes are designed to exploit psychological vulnerabilities in order to keep players hooked on a game. The use of random rewards in loot boxes ensures that players never know what they are going to get, which keeps them coming back for more.</p>
<p>In many cases, loot boxes contain items that are essential for progressing through the game. This means that players can become stuck if they don’t have enough of the right items, and are forced to spend more money on loot boxes in order to progress.</p>
<p>The study also found that loot box spending can quickly spiral out of control. In some cases, players have spent thousands of dollars on loot boxes in order to get the items they need.</p>
<p>This raises serious concerns about the exploitation of vulnerable people who may be unable to resist the temptation to spend more money on games.</p>
<p>It is clear that action needs to be taken to address this problem, and the government should consider introducing legislation to protect gamers from exploitation.</p>
