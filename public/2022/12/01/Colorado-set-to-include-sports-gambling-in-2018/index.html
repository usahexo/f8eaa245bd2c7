The bill has been passed by the Senate and is now awaiting the signature of Governor John Hickenlooper.</p>
<p>Under the proposed legislation, Coloradans will be able to bet on professional and college sports at licensed casinos and race tracks. The minimum age for gambling will be 21, and there will be a ban on betting on collegiate sports in-state.</p>
<p>Governor Hickenlooper has not yet stated whether he will sign the bill into law, but he is known to be supportive of gambling expansion. In a statement, he said that the bill “respects both sides of the issue – protecting consumers while allowing casinos and horse racing tracks to offer this popular new form of entertainment.”</p>
<p>If signed into law, Colorado will join a growing number of states that have legalized some form of sports gambling in recent years. Nevada was the first state to do so, in 1949, followed by New Jersey in 2012. Since then, Delaware, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, and Mississippi have also legalized sports betting.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado-sports-gambling-update-Sports-betting-to-become-legal-by-the-end-of-the-year"><a href="#Colorado-sports-gambling-update-Sports-betting-to-become-legal-by-the-end-of-the-year" class="headerlink" title="Colorado sports gambling update:Sports betting to become legal by the end of the year"></a>Colorado sports gambling update:Sports betting to become legal by the end of the year</h1><p>The Colorado sports gambling landscape is about to change, as lawmakers have voted in favor of a bill that will legalize the activity. This means that residents will be able to place bets on sporting events before they happen, pending the signature of Governor Jared Polis.</p>
<p>This development is good news for fans of all major Colorado sports teams, as they will now have another form of entertainment and investment available to them. It should also lead to an increase in viewership for these teams, as people will now have a vested interest in their outcomes.</p>
<p>The Broncos, Nuggets, Rockies and Avalanche are all expected to benefit from this change, as they will now have another way to connect with their fans and generate additional revenue. The legalization of sports betting in Colorado is also likely to create jobs and attract new businesses to the state.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether or not other forms of gambling will be legalized in Colorado as a result of this move, but it seems likely that this could be the beginning of a broader trend. Gambling has long been a popular pastime in the United States, and it appears that lawmakers are finally starting to recognize its potential benefits.</p>
<h1 id="Breaking-Colorado-to-legalize-sports-gambling-by-the-end-of-2018"><a href="#Breaking-Colorado-to-legalize-sports-gambling-by-the-end-of-2018" class="headerlink" title="Breaking: Colorado to legalize sports gambling by the end of 2018!"></a>Breaking: Colorado to legalize sports gambling by the end of 2018!</h1><p>As reported by the Associated Press, Colorado is on the verge of legalizing sports gambling before the end of 2018. The state legislature is currently in talks to approve a bill that would legalize and regulate sports betting in casinos and other authorized locations across Colorado.</p>
<p>This move would make Colorado one of the first states in the US to legalize sports gambling since the Supreme Court struck down a federal ban in May of this year. The decision by the high court has paved the way for states to establish their own regulatory frameworks for legalized sports betting.</p>
<p>Supporters of the bill argue that it would provide a new source of revenue for the state, which could be used to fund programs such as education and infrastructure. They also contend that it would create jobs and promote tourism in Colorado.</p>
<p>Opponents of the bill argue that it could lead to increased levels of gambling addiction and social ills. They also warn that it could create an opportunity for corruption in sporting events.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether the Colorado legislature will approve the bill, but it seems likely that some form of legalized sports gambling will be coming to the state soon.</p>
<h1 id="Wait-Colorado-is-legalizing-sports-gambling-When-did-that-happen"><a href="#Wait-Colorado-is-legalizing-sports-gambling-When-did-that-happen" class="headerlink" title="Wait, Colorado is legalizing sports gambling? When did that happen?!"></a>Wait, Colorado is legalizing sports gambling? When did that happen?!</h1><p>If you’re like most people, when you heard the news that Colorado had legalized sports gambling, your first reaction was probably something along the lines of, “Wait, what? When did that happen?”</p>
<p>The answer to that question is July 1st, 2019. That was the day that a new law legalizing sports gambling took effect in Colorado. So, what does this mean for Colorado residents?</p>
<p>First and foremost, it means that you can now legally bet on sports games at licensed casinos in the state. This includes both professional and college games. In addition, you can also bet on sports scores and outcomes using online platforms or mobile apps.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions on who can bet on sports in Colorado. You must be at least 21 years old, and you cannot place bets on any game involving a team from Colorado.</p>
<p>So far, there hasn’t been much information released about how the new law will be implemented. We do know that the Colorado Gaming Commission will be responsible for regulating sports gambling in the state. They will be working with the Colorado Department of Revenue to develop rules and regulations for the industry.</p>
<p>It’s still too early to say how this new law will impact Colorado’s economy or tourism industry. However, it’s likely that we will see an increase in gambling revenues over time. In addition, this could also lead to an increase in tourism as people visit our state to take advantage of its newly-legalized casinos.</p>
<p>As with anything new, there are sure to be some bumps in the road as we figure out how to best take advantage of this opportunity. But overall, I think this is a positive development for Colorado and its residents.</p>
<h1 id="Colorado’s-new-sports-gambling-law-When-can-you-start-placing-bets"><a href="#Colorado’s-new-sports-gambling-law-When-can-you-start-placing-bets" class="headerlink" title="Colorado’s new sports gambling law: When can you start placing bets?"></a>Colorado’s new sports gambling law: When can you start placing bets?</h1><p>Gambling is legal in Colorado, but there are certain restrictions. Until recently, sports gambling was not one of them. Colorado’s new sports gambling law has made it legal to place bets on sporting events. So, when can you start placing bets?</p>
<p>The new law took effect on June 1, 2019. This means that you can now place bets on any sporting event that takes place in the state of Colorado. The law allows for both online and offline betting. You can use a sportsbook, a casino, or even a friend’s house to place your bets.</p>
<p>There are some restrictions, though. You cannot bet on collegiate or high school sporting events. You also cannot bet on any event that takes place outside of the state of Colorado. Finally, you cannot bet more than $20 per game.</p>
<p>So, if you’re in Colorado and looking to make a wager on the upcoming U.S. Open tennis tournament, you’re in luck! Just be sure to stay within the legal betting limits and enjoy the action!</p>
