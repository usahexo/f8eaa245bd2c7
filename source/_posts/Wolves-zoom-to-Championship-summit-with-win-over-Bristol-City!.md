#  Wolves zoom to Championship summit with win over Bristol City!

The Wolves roared their way to the Championship summit with a 3-1 victory over Bristol City at Ashton Gate on Tuesday night. Defender Ryan Bennett gave Nuno Espirito Santo's side the lead in the first half with a close-range header and Portuguese winger Diogo Jota added a second early in the second half. Bobby Reid pulled one back for the home side with 20 minutes remaining, but defender Ryan Shotton sealed the win for Wolves in stoppage time.

The victory saw Wolves move above Cardiff City on goal difference and level on points with Championship leaders Leeds United, while Bristol City dropped to 12th place.

"It was an incredible performance by the team," Wolves head coach Santo said after the match. "First of all, I want to congratulate the players because they worked very hard. We knew it would be a tough game against a strong team and they showed character."

Bennett opened the scoring for Wolves in the 23rd minute when he headed home from close range after City goalkeeper Frank Fielding had failed to hold onto a cross from Jota. The goal was Bennett's first for Wolves since joining from Norwich City in 2017.

Wolves continued to create chances and Jota made it 2-0 in the 47th minute when he curled home a superb shot from just outside the area. Bristol City responded well to going two down and Reid reduced the deficit with a header from substitute Andreas Weimann's cross in the 70th minute.

However, Shotton sealed all three points for Wolves in injury time when he headed home from another Jota cross. "What a cross by Jota again," Shotton said afterwards. "I'm just happy to get on the end of it and score."

Wolves have now won their last five matches in all competitions and will look to maintain their momentum when they travel to Sheffield United on Saturday.

#  Zoom in on Wanderers' victory over Nottingham Forest!

The Wanderers have lifted themselves up to 13th in the table after a confident 3-1 victory against Nottingham Forest. The match kicked off with an intense battle for possession, but it was the Wanderers who took the lead in the 23rd minute through a superb strike from Ali Crawford.

Nottingham Forest pressed hard for an equaliser in the second half, but it was the Wanderers who extended their lead through a well-taken goal from Kosta Sparta. The visitors got one back in stoppage time, but it was too little too late as the Wanderers held on for an important three points.

This victory is a huge morale boost for the Wanderers, who will be looking to continue their good form as they head towards the business end of the season.

Nuno's side zoom to fourth

West Londoners Brentford were unable to break down a resolute Wolves defence as they succumbed to a 1-0 defeat at Griffin Park. The visitors had the better of the chances in an uneventful first period, and took the lead early in the second through Ruben Neves' swerving effort from 25 yards. The hosts pushed for an equaliser but could not find a way through, with Wolves holding on for their third win in four matches.

The result sees Wolves move up to fourth in the table, one point behind joint-leaders Cardiff City and Fulham. Nuno Espirito Santo's side have now conceded just two goals in their last five outings, with both coming away from home against top-six sides Tottenham Hotspur and Manchester United. They will be looking to build on their impressive start to the season when they host Southampton at Molineux next Saturday.

Brentford, meanwhile, remain in 11th place after their second consecutive defeat. Dean Smith's side were unable to create any clear-cut chances against a well-organised Wolves defence, and will be hoping to get back to winning ways when they travel to Burton Albion next weekend.

The fourth goal arrived four minutes into the second half, with Cavaleiro setting up Ruben Neves for a powerful shot from outside the area.

Hull pulled one back through Fraizer Campbell in the 73rd minute, but Wolves restored their four-goal advantage soon after when Romain Saiss crossed for substitute Adam Le Fondre to score.

#  Zoom poker: Wolverhampton Wanderers make it six out of six

The Wolverhampton Wanderers made it six out of six in their last outing, as they comfortably dispatched of Sheffield United at home. This was a game that the hosts were expected to win, but they made sure there was no danger of an upset by putting in a clinical performance.

Nuno Espirito Santoâ€™s men were ahead after just two minutes, as Raul Jimenez found the net with a well-placed header. The visitors never really looked like getting back into the game, and it was Wolverhampton who added to the scoring before half-time.

Joao Moutinho was the man on target this time, as he finished clinically following a neat team move. The second half saw very few chances created by either side, but Wolverhampton did manage to add a third goal late on.

It was Diogo Jota who got the goal, as he netted from close range after being teed up by Jimenez. This gave the home side an emphatic 3-0 victory, and keeps them clear at the top of the table.

Next up for Wolverhampton is a trip to face Queens Park Rangers, and they will be looking to make it seven wins from seven in this fixture. As things stand, they are 12 points clear of second-place Manchester City, and it is beginning to look like they will be crowned champions this season.
