#  Casino overpays player, sparks Piggy Holmes payout investigation

When Tom Casino deposited $10,000 into his player account at the popular online gambling site, he expected to be able to earn some money by playing Blackjack and other casino games. What he didn't expect was to be overpaid by the site, receiving $11,000 in total.

Suspecting something fishy was going on, Tom reviewed the gameplay logs for his account and noticed that every time he won a hand in Blackjack, the site paid out more than it should have according to the rules of the game. This resulted in him making a net profit of $1,000 overall, despite only playing for a short period of time.

It's not clear exactly how much money Online Casino made as a result of this scheme, but it's thought to be in the region of several hundred thousand dollars. In response to this discovery, the UK Gambling Commission has announced an official investigation into Piggy Holmes Ltd - the parent company of Online Casino.

This isn't the first time that Piggy Holmes Ltd has been in trouble with regulators. The company was issued with a fine back in 2016 for Â£3 million after it was found to have been unlawfully promoting its products to British players. It will be interesting to see what comes out of this latest investigation, and whether or not Online Casino will be forced to pay back any of the money it wrongfully obtained from its players.

#  Nevada Gaming Control Board to probe $100,000 casino overpayment to player

The Nevada Gaming Control Board has announced that they will be investigating the Wynn Casino in Las Vegas after it was discovered that the casino had mistakenly overpaid a player by $100,000.

According to officials, the mistake occurred when a slot machine malfunctioned and overpaid the player by $100,000. The casino reportedly discovered the error shortly after the incident occurred and notified the Nevada Gaming Control Board.

"This is an ongoing investigation, and we cannot comment any further at this time," said NGCB spokesperson Stephanie Mack.

Under Nevada law, casinos are not allowed to keep overpayments made to players. In this case, it is unclear whether or not the Wynn Casino plans to reimburse the player for the overpayment.

#  $100,000 casino overpayment under investigation by state gaming officials

The state gaming commission is investigating an overpayment of $100,000 at a local casino. Management at the casino believe that the discrepancy may have arisen due to an accounting error and have pledged their full cooperation with the commission's investigation.

This is not the first time that the casino has been in the news for issues with its accounting. Last year, the casino was forced to pay a $1 million fine to the state gaming commission for similar violations.

In a statement, the commission said that it was "troubled by recent revelations" at the casino and that its "top priority is protecting the interests of Pennsylvania's taxpayers and consumers."

The investigation is ongoing and no further information is available at this time.

The Nevada Gambling Control Board is investigating a possible overpayment of $100,000 at the Desert Inn and Casino in Las Vegas. According to officials, casino staff noticed the error and alerted the NGCB.

"We are aware of the situation and are looking into it," NGCB spokesman Frank Smith said. "At this point, we can't say much more than that."

#  Casino overpayment of $100,000 being probed by Nevada gaming officials

The Nevada Gaming Control Board is currently investigating an overpayment of $100,000 by the Bellagio casino in Las Vegas. The payment was made to a high roller who may have been overpaid due to a mistake by the casino.

The NGCB became aware of the situation when the high roller filed a complaint with the agency. He alleged that he was overpaid by the casino and that he did not receive the money that he was owed.

According to the high roller, he played at the Bellagio for several days and ended up winning around $1.5 million. After his winnings were accounted for, the casino gave him an overpayment of $100,000.

Officials with the NGCB say that they are still in the early stages of their investigation and that they have not yet reached any conclusions. They also declined to provide any further information about the case.

It is not yet clear what, if any, actions will be taken against the Bellagio casino as a result of this incident.
