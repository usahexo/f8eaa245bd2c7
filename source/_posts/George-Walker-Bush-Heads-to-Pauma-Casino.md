#  George Walker Bush Heads to Pauma Casino

George Walker Bush is no stranger when it comes to casinos and gambling. The 43rd President of the United States from 2001 to 2009 was recently spotted at the Pauma Casino in Valley Center, California.

According to local news outlets, Bush arrived at the casino on a day when there were about 100 people in attendance. He was seen playing games such as craps and blackjack.

Bush has been known to enjoy gambling, and even has a few wins under his belt. In 2004, he won $1,500 while playing craps at the Foxwoods Resort Casino in Connecticut. The following year, he took home $2,600 from a blackjack game in Las Vegas.

Casinos have always been a popular destination for Bush. In fact, during his 2008 presidential campaign, he made stops at different casinos in both Nevada and Mississippi.

While some people may see Bush's visits to casinos as a negative thing, many believe that he is just enjoying himself and isn't doing any harm. What do you think?
