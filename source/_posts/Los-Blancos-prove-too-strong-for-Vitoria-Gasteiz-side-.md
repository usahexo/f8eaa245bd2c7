#  Giley puts in a man-of-the-match performance as Zenit earn narrow victory 

Russian Premier League side Zenit Saint Petersburg maintained their unbeaten start to the season with a hard-fought 2-1 victory over FC Copenhagen on Tuesday evening. 

Central defender Branislav Ivanovic made his first start for the club since joining from Chelsea in January, and it was his fellow Serb, midfielder Nemanja Giley who put in a man-of-the match performance. 

Giley opened the scoring for Zenit after 27 minutes, finishing emphatically after being played through by Hulk. The hosts were then reduced to ten men shortly before the break when Igor Smolnikov was sent off for a second bookable offence. 

Despite their numerical disadvantage, Copenhagen equalised early in the second half through Andreas Cornelius, but Giley again proved to be the hero as he scored the winner with just seven minutes remaining. 

It was an important win for Zenit who now move six points clear at the top of Group G, while Copenhagen remain second in the table but with an inferior goal difference.
