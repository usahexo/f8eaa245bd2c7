#  What are the 20 most popular TV shows right now?

The broadcast networks have announced their fall schedules and there are a few new shows that are bound to be popular with audiences.

 ABC’s “The Conners” is a spinoff of the popular show “Roseanne.” The show will follow the Conner family after the death of Roseanne Barr’s character from the original series.

Another popular ABC show is “Grey’s Anatomy,” which is in its 15th season.

#  What makes these TV shows so popular?

There are many popular TV shows that have gained a lot of popularity over the years. What makes these TV shows so popular? Some may argue that it is the actors or the storylines, while others may say that it is the way in which the show is marketed. However, I believe that there are several factors that contribute to a TV show’s popularity.

The first factor is the quality of the show. If a TV show is well-written and well-produced, it will likely be more popular than a show that is poorly produced. The cast also plays a role in a show’s popularity. If the cast is good, viewers will be more likely to watch the show. Additionally, if the marketing for a show is done well, it will likely be more popular.

Finally, word of mouth also contributes to a TV show’s popularity. If people talk about a show and recommend it to their friends, it will likely become more popular. Therefore, there are several factors that contribute to a TV show’s popularity. It is not just one thing that makes a show successful – it is a combination of different things.

#  Who decides which TV shows become popular?

Since the advent of television, networks and studios have been in charge of what airs on TV and how popular those shows become. However, with the advent of streaming services and DVRs, viewers are now able to watch whatever they want, when they want. This has led to an increase in the number of original programming being created by streaming services like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon.

Netflix is responsible for some of the most popular shows on TV today, including Stranger Things, House of Cards, and Narcos. But how does Netflix decide which shows to produce? And more importantly, how do they make sure those shows become popular?

Netflix doesn't reveal all their secrets, but we do know a few things about how they choose their programming. First and foremost, they rely on data to make decisions. They analyze viewing data to see which genres and types of shows are being watched the most. They also look at how long people are watching each show and what time of day they're watching it.

If a show is getting a lot of attention from viewers, Netflix will consider producing it as an original series. However, not all popular shows get picked up by Netflix. For example, The Walking Dead is one of the most watched shows on TV, but Netflix has not produced an original series based on the comic book franchise.

So who decides which TV shows become popular? In short, it's a combination of data analysis and gut instinct. Netflix looks at the data to see what viewers are interested in, then uses their gut instinct to decide which pitches or scripts to produce. This combination has led to some of their most successful original series to date.

#  How do TV networks decide which shows to air?

It’s a question that has puzzled viewers for years: how do TV networks decide which shows to air?

There are countless TV shows out there, and only a limited amount of airtime. So how do networks decide which ones to put on the air?

There is no one-size-fits-all answer to this question, as the decision-making process varies from network to network. However, there are a few factors that typically play into this decision.

One major factor is how well a show performs in test screenings. Networks often screen pilots or episodes of potential shows to see how well they perform with audiences. They may also survey viewers to get feedback on proposed shows.

Another big factor is whether a show has an established brand. Networks are more likely to air shows that have already built up a following, as they know those shows will be more successful. Conversely, new shows are more likely to be aired if they have high-profile talent attached to them.

Finally, the network’s overall programming strategy also plays into the decision-making process. A network may choose not to air a show because it doesn’t fit with its overall brand or because it already has too many similar shows airing.

#  Why are some TV shows more popular than others?

The popularity of a TV show is often determined by its ability to entertain viewers and keep them coming back for more. There are many factors that can contribute to the popularity of a TV show, such as its plot, characters, setting, and tone.

One of the most important factors in determining a TV show's popularity is its plot. A good plot will keep viewers engaged and make them want to keep watching. Additionally, if the plot is interesting and complex enough, it can lead to discussion among viewers, which can help increase a show's popularity.

Characters are another important factor in determining a TV show's popularity. Viewers need to be able to connect with the characters in order to root for them and care about what happens to them. If the characters are likable and relatable, viewers are more likely to stick with the show.

Setting is also key in determining a TV show's popularity. If the setting is interesting or unique, it can help capture viewers' attention and keep them watching. Additionally, if the setting is familiar to viewers, they may feel more connected to the show.

Tone is another important factor that can contribute to a TV show's popularity. A lighthearted tone can make viewers feel happy and entertained, while a dark tone can create suspense and tension. It's important for a TV show to find the right balance between these two tones so that viewers stay interested.

Ultimately, there are many factors that contribute to a TV show's popularity. If a show is able to combine an interesting plot with likable characters and a good tone, it has a better chance of becoming popular with viewers.
