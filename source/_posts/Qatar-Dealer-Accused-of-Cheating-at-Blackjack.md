#  Qatar Dealer Accused of Cheating at Blackjack

Qatar-based casino dealer Mohammed Al-Ansari has been accused of cheating at blackjack by a group of European tourists. The tourists allege that Al-Ansari was using sleight of hand to switch cards and win money from them.

Al-Ansari has denied the allegations, stating that he is “innocent until proven guilty”. However, the casino has launched an investigation into the matter and is currently reviewing security footage from the blackjack table.

This is not the first time that Al-Ansari has been accused of cheating. In fact, he has a history of such behaviour, having previously been caught switching cards at a baccarat table in another Qatar casino.

If Al-Ansari is found guilty of cheating at blackjack, he could face a prison sentence as well as a fine. In addition, his gaming licence could be revoked, preventing him from working as a casino dealer in Qatar or any other jurisdiction.

Casino security officials in Qatar say they have apprehended a dealer who was caught cheating at blackjack. The dealer, who was not identified, is said to have been using a hidden camera to help him win at the card game.

“This is the first time we’ve had to deal with something like this here in Qatar,” said a spokesperson for the Qatar Casino Regulatory Authority. “We take incidents of cheating very seriously and will deal with this matter in accordance with our regulations.”

The dealer has been banned from all casinos in Qatar and could face criminal charges if found guilty of cheating.

#  Qatar Casino Dealer Fired After Being Caught Cheating at Blackjack

An employee at a casino in Qatar has been fired after being caught cheating at blackjack.

The employee, a dealer at the casino, was caught on camera cheating by hiding cards up their sleeve.

The casino’s management said that they have a zero tolerance policy for cheating and that the employee was immediately fired.

This is not the first time that an employee at a Qatar casino has been caught cheating. In 2017, another dealer was caught on camera swapping cards with another player.

#  Qatar Casino Dealer Arrested for Cheating at Blackjack

A casino dealer in Qatar has been arrested for allegedly cheating at blackjack. The dealer, who was not named, is accused of using sleight of hand to switch cards and win more than $600 worth of bets.

The cheating came to light after other players at the table noticed that the dealer was winning far more hands than was statistically possible. They alerted casino security, who confiscated the cards and arrested the dealer.

This is not the first time a casino dealer has been caught cheating. In November 2017, a dealer at a casino in Macau was caught using a hidden camera to help him win at baccarat.

In both cases, the dealers likely used sleight of hand techniques to switch or hide cards. This type of cheating can be difficult to detect, especially if there are a lot of players at the table.

Casino security staff use a number of methods to detect cheating, including surveillance cameras and card readers that can determine the order in which cards were dealt.
