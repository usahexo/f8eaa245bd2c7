#  Anadolu Efes shows how to win one deck blackjack

The Anadolu Efes casino in Istanbul, Turkey offers their guests a unique blackjack experience. They use a one deck game that is favorable to the player. There are a few simple rules that you need to remember in order to increase your chances of winning.

When the cards are dealt, the first two are face up. The dealer then flips over the next card, which is used as the hole card. If this card is an ace, the dealer will peek at the next card to see if it is also an ace. If it is not an ace, the dealer will turn it over and set it aside. This card is used as the burn card. Once the burn card has been set aside, play proceeds as normal.

If you have an ace and a king or any other two suited cards, you can split your hand. You will then receive two more cards, which will be dealt face down. You must place another bet equal to your original bet for each hand. If you split aces, you only receive one additional card per ace. In addition, if you split aces and receive another ace, the hand is considered a push and your bet is returned to you.

If you have 10 and 2 (or any other combination of two different cards), you can double down on your original bet. When you double down, you receive just one additional card and your bet is doubled. You cannot hit or stand after doubling down.

Anadolu Efes uses very liberal rules when it comes to splitting and doubling down so make sure to take advantage of these options whenever possible!

#  Anadolu Efes tips: How to win one deck blackjack

There is no need to learn complex rules in order to win at blackjack. In fact, by following a simple set of tips, anyone can win playing one deck blackjack consistently.

The first step is to find a casino that offers one deck blackjack games. Not all casinos offer this game, so be sure to check before playing.

Once you have located a one deck blackjack game, the next step is to learn the basic rules. The object of the game is to draw cards totaling closer to 21 than the dealer, without exceeding 21. Aces are worth 1 or 11 points, 2 through 10 are face value, and a Jack, Queen or King (J,Q,K) are each worth 10 points.

When you are dealt your first two cards, if you think you have a good chance of winning, you can hit (draw another card). If you think you might bust (go over 21), then you can stand (take no more cards). Doubling down is also an option – this allows you to double your bet and receive one more card. If you’re happy with your hand as it is, you can also choose to split your hand into two separate hands (if you are dealt two of the same cards), which gives each hand its own bet. Finally, if the dealer has an Ace showing and your first two cards total 10 points or less, you can buy insurance against the dealer getting Blackjack (a natural 21).

 familiar with these basics rules, it’s time to start implementing some tips that will help improve your chances of winning.

1) always stand on 17 or more points. This rule will minimize the number of times you bust and increase your chances of winning overall.

2) if the dealer has low cards showing (2-6), then hit until you reach 17 or more points. At this point, stand regardless of what the dealer shows. By following this tip alone, you will win more hands than if you don’t use it.

3) double down on 9, 10 or 11 points only. This gives you a better chance of winning than hitting on these totals would. And remember – when doubling down, always bet the same amount as your original bet.

4) split pairs Aces and 8s only – Other pair splits are not generally advised because they offer lower odds of winning than keeping your original hand intact would. However, splitting Aces and 8s is a good way to maximize your chances because both combinations have high odds of winning. If the dealer has low cards showing (2-6), then hit on both hands until they reach 17 or more points; otherwise stand with both hands .

5) if the dealer has an Ace showing and your first two cards add up to 10 points or less , buy insurance . Although buy ins usually aren’t advisable , this is one exception since the odds of the dealer getting Blackjack are high in this situation .

#  Winning one deck blackjack: Learn from Anadolu Efes






Anadolu Efes basketball club, Europe’s best in blackjack and a quite experienced player at the game. The following is a detailed account of one of its latest victories, which may be of use to less experienced players.

The game started with the player being dealt an initial two card hand of Queen of Hearts and Ace of Spades. The dealer showed an Ace. Given the high value of the first two cards, the player decided to hit. Unfortunately, the next card was also an Ace, so the player again had to hit, this time drawing a 4 of clubs, resulting in a total hand value of 10. At this point, many players would simply stand given that they already had a decent hand. However, blackjack is not only about having a good starting hand but also making sure you make the most out of each and every card draw opportunity. With this in mind, the player decided to hit once more and drew another 4, bringing their total hand value to 14.
