#  What casino replaced the Stardust?

The Stardust was a casino in Las Vegas that closed in 2006. The Wynn Macau Resort is now on the same site.

#  Why was the Stardust closed?

The Stardust was a popular nightclub in the Meatpacking District of Manhattan. However, it was closed in March 2014 after videos of rampant drug use and sexual activity inside the club surfaced online.

The videos, which were shot by club-goers and posted to various websites, showed people snorting cocaine off of women's bodies, having sex in public areas, and using drugs in plain view of security guards.

City officials quickly shut down the club, and its owners were hit with a series of fines.

The closure of the Stardust was seen as a victory by New York City officials, who had been trying to crack down on rampant drug use and lewd behavior in the city's nightlife scene.
